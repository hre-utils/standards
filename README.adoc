The principals by which HRE Utils shall all adhere, and the prerequisite boilerplate for such utilities.

== Principals
=== Make it functional
Above all else, everything must work.
It must serve a clear and defined purpose.
=== Make it interesting
There may be an _easier_ way to do something.
There may be a _better_ suited tool or a language for the problem at hand.

=== Make it right

== Standards
=== Directories
Have respect for the user's standard paths: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `$XDG_DATA_HOME`
